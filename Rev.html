			<p>Increase your access to God and ultimately your spiritual power by using web and mobile based solutions for tracking spiritual growth.
			<p>Think about your access to God as a simple electric circuit... a battery connected by wires to a light bulb.</p>

			<p>There are two ways to make your light bulb glow brighter, (1) use a stronger battery and (2) use a higher gauge wire</p>
			<p>rEv uses this basic principal to increase Spiritual Power, make your spiritual light bulb glow brighter.
				rEv looks to increase (1) Spiritual Potential (battery) and (2) Spiritual Current (wire).</p>
